I am an enthusiastic, self motivated Junior Full Stack Developer and recent graduate of [Makers](http://makers.tech/) - a highly selective, fully immersive, four-month bootcamp in software development. 

After leaving Aston University with a business degree, I moved to London and spent 15 years working in head office merchandising roles. While this career provided financial stability, it ultimately proved to offer little satisfaction so I decided that I needed a new direction and a new challenge.   

I have always been excited by technology and fascinated by it. I’m intrigued by the workings of home automation and smart technology, as well as the complex processes of fintech. I’m curious to learn even more, and keen to start my new career in London’s thriving tech scene.

## Skills

The aspects of my earlier jobs that I enjoyed most and excelled at all have aspects of software development to them. These included creating formulas in excel, automating reports, making processes more efficient and imparting my knowledge to others when providing coaching on business systems.

#### Analysis and Problem Solving

Working in merchandising you have access to a huge amount of data which you must analyse quickly to make decisions, and are faced with often conflicting priorities.

- In my role as Category Merchandiser at QVC I was integral in developing tools and processes to forecast sales and margin across multiple sales channels and product categories
- Along with the commercial analytics team, I developed a tool which automated the production of reports which were previously run manually, saving users hours of work
- At BHS, I made quick decisions based on analysis about the next action for a product, such as to reorder or markdown, whilst considering KPIs and seasonality 

#### Coaching 

Throughout my career I have been regularly identified as a mentor and coach for new recruits, not only for my in-depth knowledge and understanding of tools and processes but also due to my approachable, calm and patient demeanour.

- Trained new recruits and graduate trainees on business systems at QVC
- Made expert user for SAP purchasing when rolled out at Woolworths
- Delivered a training workshop to account managers at Unilever on a business information system using business objects which I helped develop
